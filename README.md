# Integrative Historical Prediction (IHP) Framework

## Overview

The Integrative Historical Prediction (IHP) framework is a novel approach to analyzing and forecasting complex societal phenomena. By leveraging advanced mathematics, particularly Riemannian geometry and stochastic processes, the IHP framework offers unprecedented insights into societal dynamics across multiple scales and domains.

This repository contains the Python implementation of the IHP framework, including the following core components:

1. Event Continuum Mapping (ECM) system
2. Societal Dynamics Engine (SDE)
3. Predictive Modeling Algorithm (PMA)
4. Multiscale Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN)

The framework is demonstrated through three case studies:

1. Retrospective analysis of the Arab Spring
2. Near-future predictions of global cryptocurrency adoption
3. Long-term forecasting of climate-induced migration patterns

## Installation

To install the IHP framework and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ihp-framework.git
   cd ihp-framework
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the IHP framework for analysis and prediction, you can follow these general steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from ihp_framework import ECM, SDE, PMA, MTCN
   ```

2. Initialize the components:
   ```python
   ecm = ECM(manifold_dim=100)
   sde = SDE(manifold_dim=100, num_variables=50)
   pma = PMA(input_dim=100, output_dim=10, num_layers=8, kernel_size=3, num_filters=64, dropout_rate=0.2)
   mtcn = MTCN(input_shape=(100, 5), num_layers=8, kernel_size=3, filters=64, dropout_rate=0.2, output_dim=1)
   ```

3. Load and preprocess your data:
   ```python
   data = load_and_preprocess_data()
   ```

4. Perform analysis and generate predictions:
   ```python
   ecm_results = ecm.analyze_event_patterns(data)
   sde_results = sde.simulate_dynamics(data)
   predictions = pma.predict(data)
   mtcn_results = mtcn.fit_and_predict(data)
   ```

5. Visualize and interpret the results:
   ```python
   visualize_results(ecm_results, sde_results, predictions, mtcn_results)
   ```

For detailed usage examples, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory.

## Case Studies

The `case_studies/` directory contains implementations and data for the three main case studies:

1. `arab_spring/`: Retrospective analysis of the Arab Spring events
2. `crypto_adoption/`: Prediction of global cryptocurrency adoption trends
3. `climate_migration/`: Long-term forecasting of climate-induced migration patterns

Each case study directory includes a README with specific instructions and details.
