# Riemannian Manifold Module

## Overview

The Riemannian Manifold module is a core component of the Integrative Historical Prediction (IHP) framework. It provides a geometric representation of societal states and dynamics, allowing for sophisticated analysis and prediction of complex societal phenomena.

This module implements the mathematical foundation for representing societal states as points on a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold, where the manifold's geometry encodes the intricate relationships and dynamics within society.

## Key Features

- **SocietalManifold**: A class representing the Riemannian manifold of societal states.
- **ParallelTransporter**: Handles parallel transport of vectors along curves on the manifold.
- **GeodesicFlow**: Computes geodesic flows along vector fields on the manifold.
- **SocietalTensorField**: Represents and manipulates tensor fields on the manifold.
- Lyapunov spectrum computation for analyzing stability of societal trajectories.
- Advanced numerical methods for geodesic computation, exponential and logarithmic maps.
- Curvature calculations including Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci curvature, and scalar curvature.

## Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```
numpy
scipy
geomstats
```

You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy geomstats
```

Then, include the `riemannian_module.py` file in your project.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Riemannian Manifold module:

```python
from riemannian_module import SocietalManifold, ParallelTransporter, GeodesicFlow
import numpy as np

# Initialize a societal manifold
metric_params = {'scale': 10, 'epsilon': 1e-6, 'amplitude': 1, 'base': 0.1}
manifold = SocietalManifold(dim=5, metric_params=metric_params)

# Compute geodesic between two points
initial_point = np.random.rand(5)
end_point = np.random.rand(5)
geodesic = manifold.geodesic(initial_point, end_point)

# Parallel transport a vector along the geodesic
vector = np.random.rand(5)
transporter = ParallelTransporter(manifold)
transported_vector = transporter.parallel_transport(vector, geodesic)

# Compute geodesic flow
def vector_field(x):
    return -x  # Example vector field
flow = GeodesicFlow(manifold)
flow_result = flow.flow(initial_point, vector_field, time_span=1.0)

# Compute Lyapunov spectrum
trajectory = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Example trajectory
lyapunov_spectrum = compute_lyapunov_spectrum(manifold, trajectory, num_exponents=3)
```

## Mathematical Background

This module implements concepts from differential geometry and dynamical systems theory:

- The societal state space is modeled as a Riemannian manifold, where the metric tensor encodes the local structure of society.
- Geodesics represent the "natural" evolution of societal states.
- Parallel transport allows for comparing vectors (representing trends or forces) at different points on the manifold.
- The curvature of the manifold can indicate areas of societal stress or rapid change.
- Lyapunov exponents provide a measure of the predictability and stability of societal trajectories.

## Performance and Customization

The current implementation uses numerical integration techniques which may be computationally intensive for very high-dimensional manifolds. For large-scale applications, consider:

- Implementing GPU acceleration for numerical computations.
- Using approximate methods for geodesic computation in high dimensions.
- Customizing the metric tensor based on domain-specific knowledge or empirical data.
