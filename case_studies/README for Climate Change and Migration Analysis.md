# Climate Change and Migration Analysis using IHP Framework

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on global migration patterns using the Integrative Historical Prediction (IHP) framework. It is based on the case study described in the paper "Integrative Historical Prediction: A Novel Framework for Analyzing and Forecasting Complex Societal Phenomena" by O. Austegard and C. Sonnett.

The analysis integrates multiple data sources, employs advanced mathematical modeling techniques, and leverages machine learning to forecast potential migration patterns over the next 50 years under various climate change scenarios.

## Features

- Data integration from diverse sources including climate projections, geographic vulnerability assessments, demographic data, and economic indicators
- System dynamics modeling of climate-migration interactions
- Cellular automaton simulation for spatial migration patterns
- Gaussian Process Regression for climate projections
- Multiscale Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN) for migration flow prediction
- Identification of potential climate havens and tipping points
- Analysis of regional migration hotspots

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climate-migration-analysis.git
   cd climate-migration-analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure all required data files are in the `data` directory.

2. Run the main analysis script:
   ```
   python climate_migration_analysis.py
   ```

3. The script will output a summary of the results, including:
   - Total displaced population by 2070
   - Regional migration hotspots
   - Potential climate havens
   - Migration increase in a 2°C warming scenario
   - Identified climate tipping points

## Data Sources

This analysis requires the following data files:

- `cmip6_climate_projections.csv`: Climate projections from CMIP6
- `geographic_vulnerability.json`: Geographic vulnerability assessments
- `population_projections.csv`: Demographic data and projections
- `economic_indicators.csv`: Economic indicators
- `agricultural_projections.csv`: Agricultural and food security projections
- `historical_migration.csv`: Historical migration data
- `policy_scenarios.json`: Climate policy scenarios

Ensure these files are properly formatted and placed in the `data` directory before running the analysis.

## Customization

You can customize the analysis by modifying the following parameters in the `climate_migration_analysis.py` file:

- `manifold_dim`: Dimension of the Riemannian manifold (default: 100)
- `num_variables`: Number of variables in the system dynamics model (default: 50)
- `temp_threshold`: Temperature threshold for the 2°C scenario (default: 2.0)
